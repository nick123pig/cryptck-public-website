<h3><a id="9_Paid_Services_And_Fees_78"></a>9. Paid Services And Fees</h3>
<p>Certain <a href="http://cryptck.com">cryptck.com</a> services are paid services. This section explains how we handle payments for those services. For certain paid services, such as domain registrations and site subscriptions, we’ll automatically bill you in regular intervals (such as monthly or annually) unless you disable auto-renewal or cancel your subscription. You can do that anytime.</p>
<p>9.1. Fees. You can access certain portions of the Services by submitting a fee payment (such additional services, “Paid Services”). For example, to publish Your Sites publicly, you’ll need to pay a subscription fee. Paid Services will remain in effect until cancelled or terminated in accordance with this Agreement. We’ll tell you about fees for Paid Services before charging you. If you don’t pay for Paid Services on time, we reserve the right to suspend or cancel your access to the Paid Services. Transaction fees and additional fees may also apply to certain portions of the Services, and we’ll tell you about those fees before charging you. Our fees will appear on an invoice that we provide via the Services, unless otherwise indicated.</p>
<p>9.2. Taxes. All fees are exclusive of applicable federal, state, local or other taxes (“Taxes”). You’re responsible for all applicable Taxes, and we’ll charge Taxes in addition to the fees for the Services when required to do so. If you’re exempt from Taxes, you must provide us with a valid tax exemption certificate (we reserve the right to determine whether a certificate is valid). Tax exemption will only apply from and after the date we receive such certificate.</p>
<p>9.3. Automatic Subscription Renewals. To ensure uninterrupted service, we’ll automatically bill you for certain Paid Services from the date you submit your initial payment and on each renewal period thereafter until cancellation. Your renewal period will be equal in time to the renewal period of your current subscription. For example, if you’re on a monthly subscription plan, each billable renewal period will be for one month. We’ll automatically charge you the applicable amount using the payment method you have on file with us. We’ll let you know in advance if you’re purchasing a Paid Service that includes auto-renewal payments. You can disable auto-renewal at any time via the Services or by contacting Customer Care.</p>
<p>9.4. Refunds. While you may cancel any Paid Services at any time, you won’t be issued a refund except in our sole discretion, or if legally required.</p>
<p>9.5. Fee Changes. We may change our fees at any time. When applicable, we’ll give you advance notice of these fee changes via the Services. New fees will not apply retroactively. If you don’t agree with the fee changes, you have the right to reject the change by cancelling the applicable Paid Service before your next payment date.</p>
<p>9.6. Chargebacks. If you contact your bank or credit card company to decline, chargeback or otherwise reverse the charge of any payable fees to us (“Chargeback”), we may automatically terminate your Account. If you have questions about a payment made to us, we encourage you to contact Customer Care before filing a Chargeback. We reserve our right to dispute any Chargeback.</p>
<p>9.7. Our Payment Processor. We use a third party payment processor (the “Payment Processor”) to bill you through a payment account linked to your Account. The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor, in addition to this Agreement. Our current Payment Processor is Stripe, and your payments are processed by Stripe in accordance with Stripe’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We don’t control and are not liable for the security or performance of the Payment Processor. You agree to pay us, through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for any purchase in accordance with the applicable payment terms. You agree to make payment using the payment method you provide with your Account. We reserve the right to correct, or to instruct our Payment Processor to correct, any errors or mistakes, even if payment has already been requested or received.</p>
<p>9.8. Fees For Third Party Services. Third Party Services purchased via the Services may be subject to different refund policies that those Third Party Services determine, and they may be non-refundable. The purchase terms and conditions for such Third Party Services will be displayed during the purchase process, such as through a link to the purchase terms and conditions. It’s your responsibility to verify your ability to purchase, cancel or obtain a refund for a Third Party Service. We don’t offer refunds for purchases of Third Party Services.</p>
<h3><a id="10_98"></a>10.</h3>

<h3><a id="12_Warranty_Disclaimers_106"></a>12. Warranty Disclaimers</h3>
<p>We work hard to make <a href="http://cryptck.com">cryptck.com</a> great, but the Services are provided as is, without warranties.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, Eigenvector LLC makes no warranties, either express or implied, about the Services. The Services are provided “as is.” Eigenvector LLC” also disclaims any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from <a href="http://cryptck.com">cryptck.com</a> shall create any warranty. <a href="http://cryptck.com">cryptck.com</a> makes no warranty or representation that the Services will: (a) be timely, uninterrupted or error-free; (b) meet your requirements or expectations; or © be free from viruses or other harmful components.</p>
<h3><a id="13_Limitation_Of_Liability_110"></a>13. Limitation Of Liability</h3>
<p>If something bad happens as a result of your using <a href="http://cryptck.com">cryptck.com</a>, Eigenvector LLC has no liability.<br />
To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event will Eigenvector LLC be liable with respect to any claims arising out of or related to the Services or this Agreement for: (a) any indirect, special, incidental, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages; (b) any loss of profits, revenue, data, goodwill or other intangible losses; © any damages related to your access to, use of or inability to access or use the Services or any portion thereof, including without limitation interruption of use or cessation or modification of any aspect of the Services; (d) any damages related to loss or corruption of any content or data, including without limitation User Content and eCommerce data; (e) any User Content or other conduct or content of any user or third party using the Services, including without limitation defamatory, offensive or unlawful conduct or content; or (f) any Third Party Services or third party sites accessed via the Services. These limitations apply to any theory of liability, whether based on warranty, contract, tort, negligence, strict liability or any other legal theory, whether or not Eigenvector LLC has been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed its essential purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event shall the aggregate liability of Eigenvector LLC for all claims arising out of or related to the Services and this Agreement exceed the greater of one dollar ($1) or the amounts paid by you to Eigenvector LLC in the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event that gave rise to such claim. Some places don’t allow the types of limitations in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.</p>
<h3><a id="14_Indemnification_115"></a>14. Indemnification</h3>
<p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless Eigenvector LLC from and against all damages, losses and expenses of any kind (including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) arising out of or related to: (a) your breach of this Agreement; (b) your User Content, Your Sites; © any claims from your End Users; and (d) your violation of any law or regulation or the rights of any third party.</p>
<h3><a id="15_Dispute_Resolution_119"></a>15. Dispute Resolution</h3>
<p>Before filing a claim against Eigenvector LLC, you agree to try to work it out informally with us first. All formal disputes must be resolved through arbitration following the rules described below, unless you opt out of arbitration following the procedure described below. Claims can only be brought individually, and not as part of a class action.</p>
<p>15.1. Informal Resolution. Before filing a claim against Eigenvector LLC, you agree to try to resolve the dispute by first emailing <a href="mailto:legal@cryptck.com">legal@cryptck.com</a> with a description of your claim. We’ll try to resolve the dispute informally by following up via email, phone or other methods. If we can’t resolve the dispute within ninety (90) days of our receipt of your first email, you or Eigenvector LLC may then bring a formal proceeding.</p>
<p>15.2. Arbitration Agreement. You and Eigenvector LLC agree to resolve any claims arising from or relating to the Services or this Agreement through final and binding arbitration and you and Eigenvector LLC expressly waive trial by jury, except as set forth below. Discovery and rights to appeal in arbitration are generally more limited than in a lawsuit, and other rights that you and we would have in court may not be available in arbitration. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.</p>
<p>15.3. Arbitration Opt-Out. You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by emailing us at <a href="mailto:arbitration-optout@cryptck.com">arbitration-optout@cryptck.com</a> within thirty (30) days of the date that you first agree to this Agreement (“Opt-Out Period”). Your email must be sent from the email address you use for your Account, and must include your full name, residential address and a clear statement that you want to opt out of arbitration. If you opt out of arbitration pursuant to this Section 15.3, then Sections 15.2, 15.4, 15.5 and 15.6 of these Terms do not apply to you. This opt-out doesn’t affect any other sections of the Terms.  If you have any questions about this process, please contact <a href="mailto:legal@cryptck.com">legal@cryptck.com</a>.</p>
<p>15.4. Arbitration Time For Filing. Any arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration within one year after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission or default giving rise to the claim. If applicable law prohibits a one year limitation period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law.</p>
<p>15.5. If Arbitration Procedures do occur Eigenvector LLC will decide which firm will administer the arbitration.  You and Eigenvector LLC agree that this Agreement affects interstate commerce, so the US Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply and govern the interpretation and enforcement of these provisions (despite the choice of law provision below). Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be chosen by Eigenvector LLC in English, and shall be settled by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes. The arbitrator must follow this Agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs), except that the arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p>15.6. Arbitration Fees. Eigenvector LLC has the right to seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration.</p>
<p>15.7. Exceptions To Arbitration Agreement. Either you or Eigenvector LLC may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court.  Either you or Eigenvector LLC may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement or misappropriation (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute resolution process described above.</p>
<p>15.8. Judicial Forum For Disputes; Time For Filing. If our agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, or if you opt out of arbitration pursuant to Section 15.3, you and Eigenvector LLC agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) must be brought exclusively in the federal court of Eigenvector LLC’s choosing and you and Eigenvector LLC consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in those courts. Any claim not subject to arbitration must be commenced within 6 months after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission or default giving rise to the claim. If applicable law prohibits a one year limitation period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law.</p>
<p>15.9. NO CLASS ACTIONS. You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated or representative action. Class actions, class arbitrations, private attorney general actions and consolidation with other arbitrations aren’t allowed.</p>
<h3><a id="16_Additional_Terms_141"></a>16. Additional Terms</h3>
<p>This Agreement is the whole agreement between us regarding your use of <a href="http://cryptck.com">cryptck.com</a>. Also, if you’re reading this in a language other than English, note that the English language version controls.</p>
<p>16.1. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Eigenvector LLC regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, and supersedes and replaces any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement creates no third party beneficiary rights.</p>
<p>16.2. Waiver, Severability And Assignment. Our failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement is not a waiver of our right to do so later. If any provision of this Agreement is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under this Agreement, and any such attempt will be void. We may assign our rights under this Agreement to any of our affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.</p>
<p>16.3. Modifications. We may modify this Agreement from time to time, and will always post the most current version on our site. By continuing to use or access the Services after any modifications come into effect, you agree to be bound by the modified Agreement. If you disagree with our changes, then you should stop using the Services.</p>
<p>16.4. Translation. This Agreement was originally written in English (US). We may translate this Agreement into other languages. In the event of a conflict between a translated version and the English version, the English version will control</p>
